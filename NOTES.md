## Objectives
Get comfortable with using form helpers, having models interact with each other, and building out a simple sessions system.
You're going to be building an amusement park. There will be *users*, *attractions*, and users can take *rides* on attractions.

## Instructions
Check out The Demo to see where this lab is headed.
This is a test driven lab, check out the model tests and get those to pass before moving onto the feature specs.
Remember, if you use scaffolds or generators do not overwrite the model specs that are included in this lab. Always use the --no-test-framework flag and enter n or no when prompted to overwrite the model specs for this lab.
A hint about requiring a password: ActiveRecord comes with a handy has_secure_password attribute that you can set on a model. It requires that you enable the bcrypt gem and that you add a password_digest column to your model.


Steps
1. create User, Attraction, Ride models
  1. Attraction is valid with a name, min_height, nausea_rating, happiness_rating, and ticket number
  2. Ride is valid with a user_id and a attraction_id
  3. User is valid with a name, password, happiness, nausea, height, and tickets

2. add password functionality
  1. add has_secure_password to user model
  2. add bcrypt gem to gemfile, bundle install
  3. add password_digest column to User table in migration

3. create a sessions controller
  1. methods: new, create, destroy

4. add routes to routes.rb
  1. root
  2. get /login
  3. post /login
  4. post /logout

5. views:
  1. root 'welcome#home'
  2. signup
    Signup successfully signs up as non-admin
      Signup on sign up, successfully adds a session hash
      Signup successfully logs in as non-admin
      Signup on log in, successfully adds a session hash
      Signup prevents user from viewing user show page and redirects to home page if not logged in
      Signup successfully signs up as admin
      Signup on sign up for admin, successfully adds a session hash
      Signup successfully logs in as admin
      Signup on log in, successfully adds a session hash to admins
      Signout has a link to log out from the users/show page
      Signout successfully destroys session hash when 'Log Out' is clicked
      Signout redirects to home page after logging out
      Signout has a link to log out from the users/show page when user is an admin
      Signout redirects to home page after admin logs out when user is an admin
      Signout successfully destroys session hash when 'Log Out' is clicked as admin
  3. login
    - select username from dropdown list
    - enter your password
    - submit button 'Sign In'
4. logout
  5. user/view

6. controller actions:
  2. sessions#new, sessions#create, sessions#destroy
  3. users#new, users#create, users#destroy

 form_for - this works well for forms that manage CRUD. Imagine that you have a blog posting application. A great fit for the form_for method would be the Post model. This is because the Post model would have the standard Active Record setup, and therefore it's smart to take advantage of the prepackaged functionality built into form_for. IT goes to the post METHOD.  FormBuilder pre-fill an existing Post object's data

form_tag - this works well for forms that are not directly connected with models. For example, let's say that our blog posting application has a search engine. The search form would be a great fit for using a form_tag. It goes to the post METHOD
